>  SketchAgent leverages an off-the-shelf multimodal LLM to facilitate language-driven, sequential sketch generation through an intuitive sketching language. It can sketch diverse concepts, engage in interactive sketching with humans, and edit content via chat.

## Setup
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/yael-vinker/SketchAgent.git
cd SketchAgent
```
Set up the environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sketch_agent
```

#### API Key
This repository requires an Anthropic API key. If you don't have one, [create an Anthropic account](https://console.anthropic.com/login) and follow the instructions to obtain a key.

Once you have the key, save it in the ```.env``` file:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your_key>
```

# Start Sketching! :woman_artist: :art:
## Text-to-Sketch
Generate a single sketch by running:
```
python gen_sketch.py --concept_to_draw "<your_concept_here>" 
```
For example:
```
python gen_sketch.py --concept_to_draw "sailboat" 
```

Optional arguments:
* ```--seed_mode``` Default is ```"stochastic"```. Set to ```"deterministic"``` for reproducible results.
* ```--path2save``` By default, results are saved to ```results/test/```.

## Collaborative Sketching
Collaborate with SketchAgent by alternating strokes! 
To use the interactive interface:
```
python collab_sketch.py
```
This will launch a Flask-based web application. Once running, look for the following output in the terminal:
```
Server running at: http://<your-ip-address>:5000
```
Open the provided URL in your web browser to interact with the application. Results are saved to ```results/collab_sketching/```.


## Tips:
* The ```gen_sketch.py``` script produces sketches with variability. Try running it multiple times to explore different outcomes.
* Prompts are available in the ```prompts.py file```. For unique concepts, ensure that your input prompt is clear and meaningful.

## TODOs

- [ ] Add support for chat based editing.
- [ ] Add SVG drawing process animations in HTML.
